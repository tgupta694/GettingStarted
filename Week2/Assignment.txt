Welcome to week 2 of Tech ready. Here are the assignments for this week. 
These problems focus on array, sorting and searching and will help you learn those concepts.
 
	1. Given an array which has only 0s and 1s in it, we will like you to write a program which outputs a sorted array.
	 
	Below is an example to demonstrate
	Ex1. Input: {1,0,0,1,0,1,1}
	     Output:{0,0,0,1,1,1,1}
	 
	Challenge is do it in place within the array, what does that means, 
	that means that you will modify the elements in the same input array to transform it into the output array not creating a new one.
	 
	2. Given a sorted array and a number, write a program which outputs the index of the number in the array below are couple of examples to explain this.
	 
	Ex1. Input array A{4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10} and number to find is 6, program should output that number 6 is available at 2nd index in the array
	Ex2. Input array {3, 10, 12 , 15, 100} and number 3, program should output that number 3 is available at 0th index in the array
	Ex3. Input array {3, 10, 12, 15, 100} and given number 14 program should output that number is not available in array
	 
	Hint: it is a Binary search problem, take a quick look at this stack overflow link https://stackoverflow.com/questions/249392/binary-search-in-array
 
Please submit your solutions in github, if any issues send those via email. And as always please send your questions if you have any.
